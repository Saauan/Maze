# L2_S3 AP2 Maze

Welcome to our maze program !
This project was made by Tristan Coignion, Logan Becquembois and Ajwad Tayebi
To use, it's very simple, you just have to execute the file `main_maze.py` while in the `src` folder.

**Example:**

```$python3 main_maze.py```

And then you just have to follow the instructions on the window.

Saved mazes will be located in the folder `mazes`.
You can also find some sample mazes to use in `Sample mazes`.


### For more informations:

You can read our documention by running the command (whilst in the main directory)

```$make doc```

However, if you do not have Make installed on your device, you can hope we may have uploaded the `doc` folder to the repository
